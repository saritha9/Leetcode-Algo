// Write a function that creates and returns an object.
// Given a number of US cents, return the optimal configuration (meaning the largest denominations possible) of coins in an object. Use dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

// Example: coinChange(312) returns 

// {dollars: 3, dimes: 1, pennies: 2}
// Example: coinChange(78) returns 

// {quarters: 3, pennies: 3}
// BONUS: Given an object with certain amounts of denominations of US money, alter the object so that the configuration is optimal.

// Example: coinChange({dollars: 2, dimes: 15, pennies: 5}) returns

// {dollars: 3, quarters: 2, nickels: 1}
function coinChange(cents){
    let dollars = 0;
