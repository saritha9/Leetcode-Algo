Phone interview with Saritha, 9:30am on 3/21
You are trying to make sense of a series of scrambled words (let’s say you have N different words to make sense of). You have an english dictionary loaded in an array. You need to refer to the dictionary and come up with valid words.

const dictionary = [..., ‘cafe’, … ‘face’, … ‘rainy’, ...] //Assume dictionary.length == M, usually around 100k
